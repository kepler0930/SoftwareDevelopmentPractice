# Recipe Management System — Student Starter

Starter repository for Parts A and B. Implement `RecipeManager` in Core; the Application menu and JSON loader are supplied.

## What is supplied

- `RecipeManagement.Core/Models/` — recipe model classes
- `RecipeManagement.Core/RecipeLoader.cs` — reads `data/recipes.json`
- `RecipeManagement.Core/IRecipeManager.cs` — public API
- `RecipeManagement.Application/` — console menu (options labelled PartA / PartB)
- `RecipeManagement.Tests/` — example tests
- `data/recipes.json` — recipe dataset

## What you implement

**Part A** — `RecipeManager.cs` using:

- `Dictionary<int, Recipe>`
- `List<string>`
- `LinkedList<int>`
- `Stack<int>`
- `Queue<string>`

**Part B** — LINQ searches, protein report, saved-recipe collection, `Design.md`, and more tests.

## Build and run

Install the .NET 10 SDK and open `RecipeManagement.sln` from the repository root:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
dotnet run --project RecipeManagement.Application -- data/recipes.json
```

Until you implement `RecipeManager`, menu options print a **Not implemented** message.

## Current stage

The supplied starter project has been imported. `RecipeManager` is still the
original stub; the recipe catalogue, shopping list, cooking plan, history and
instruction queue will be implemented in later steps.

The solution builds. The three supplied example tests currently fail because
the assessed methods have not been implemented. These tests are retained and
have not been skipped or changed.

Repository: [SoftwareDevelopmentPractice](https://github.com/kepler0930/SoftwareDevelopmentPractice)

This workspace has a local SDK in `.local/dotnet`, excluded from Git. In
PowerShell, it can be used directly:

```powershell
& .\.local\dotnet\dotnet.exe build
& .\.local\dotnet\dotnet.exe test
& .\.local\dotnet\dotnet.exe run --project RecipeManagement.Application -- data/recipes.json
```

Run the console application in an interactive terminal; the supplied menu uses
`Console.Clear()`.
